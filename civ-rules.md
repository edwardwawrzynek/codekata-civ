# Rules

The game is played by four players as they compete to expand their civilizations and conquer others.

The game is played on a board with tiles representing different terrains types. Each tile offers different amounts of resources when harvested (food, production, and trade).

Players start with one city in a corner. Their city harvests the tile they are on. Once they've harvested enough production, they can create workers, armies, and more cities. Workers and armies can move, while cities are fixed. Workers move around and harvest the tile they are on. Armies can be moved, and can be used to attack enemy workers, armies, and cities.

Production is required to create armies and workers, and Food is required to keep them alive. Trade can be used to fund research that increases offensive and defensive strengths.

During the game, parts of the game are obscured by a fog of war (any area not within manhattan distance 3 of an army, worker, or city is hidden). 

## Board
The game map is a square board of dimensions 32 x 32. Each tile on the board can be one of five types:
* Ocean
* Grassland
* Hills
* Mountains
* Forests

Each tile may be occupied by at most one city, and any number of workers and/or armies.

## Players

Each player owns a number of cities, workers, and armies.

Each player has an offensive and defensive combat strength (initially 1).

## Turns

Players take turns in a linear fashion. Each turn consists of:

### Harvesting (no player interaction)
Cities harvest the tile they are on every turn. Workers harvest the tile they are on, provided they are within manhattan distance 2 of a city. Each turn, a tile can only be harvested once.

Each tile yields:
Terrain|Food|Production|Trade
-|-|-|-
Ocean|1|0|2
Grassland|2|1|0
Hills|2|2|1
Forest|2|3|0
Mountains|1|1|0

A worker that shares a tile with a city harvests 2 trade.

Each worker and army eats 1 food. If a army or worker doesn't eat (no food left), it dies. Armies will starve before workers.

At the end of the turn, 1/4 of any left over food is removed (as if by going bad).

### Production
A player spends its harvested production. 

An army cost 8 production. 
A worker costs 8 production.
A city costs 24 production.

Armies and workers must be placed on a city controlled by the player. Each army starts with 100 hitpoints.

A city may be placed on any tile not covered by the fog of war (below). A city may not be placed on another city. If a city is placed on an opponent's worker or army, it becomes theirs.

### Technology
A player spends its harvested trade.

Defensive research (20 trade) -- increases defensive combat strength by 0.1

Offensive research (20 trade) -- increases offensive combat strength by 0.1

### Movement
A player may choose to move all workers and armies north, south, east, or west or not at all.

If a army or worker is moved onto a tile with an opponent army, or worker, combat begins.

An army trying to move onto a tile is an attacking army. All armies on that tile form a defending unit.

If you wish to attack with multiple armies, they must attack individually, one after another.

### Combat
Workers are automatically killed if they get involved in combat (attacking or defending) -- don't attack with workers, they will die and deal no damage.

If there are multiple armies defending, they are considered part of the same defending unit.

Armies (both attacking and defending) get a combat modifier based on the terrain they are currently on:
Terrain|Modifier
-|-
Ocean|0.5
Grassland|1.0
Hills|1.5
Forest|1.5
Mountains|2.0
City (multiplied by tile type bonus)|1.5


Each attacking/or defensing unit is dealt damage equal to:
$$
\frac{myOffensiveStrength}{theirDefensiveStrength} * myNumArmies * \frac{1}{theirNumArmies} * \frac{myTerrainModifier}{theirTerrainModifier} * 100
$$

If attacking, `myNumArmies` is always `1`. Armies always attack alone (but they can attack one after another).

If there are multiple defending armies in the deffending unit, they all take the same damage (defined by the equation above).

Any army with 0 or less hitpoint dies at the end of combat.

If all defending armies are killed, the attacking army moves into that tile. 

For example, if both players have offensive and defensive strengths on 1, and if an army is attacking from hills against two armies in a city in mountains, the attacking army deals `(1/1)*1*(1/2)*(1.5/(2.0*1.5))*100` to each defending army, and the attacking army takes `(1/1)*2*(1/1)*((2.0*1.5)/1.5)*100`.

### Capturing a city
If an army successfully moves into an opponent's city, they gain ownership of it and any of the opponent's workers and armies within manhattan distance 2.

### Fog of War
All tiles are hidden from a player, unless they are within manhattan distance of 3 from that player's city, worker, or army.

## Winning
The game is won once one player is the only one that controls any cities.
